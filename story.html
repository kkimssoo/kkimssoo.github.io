		<h1>Our story.</h1>
		<p>It all began with a fight.</p>

		<p>FROM, an app designed to help people appreciate the kindness of their loved ones, came to life after one young couple had argued too many times over forgetting the gifts they had received from each other.</p>

		<p>Fast forward to 2013. That couple decided to stop fighting and instead create  a tool that would resolve their issue, ultimately developing FROM, an app that allows people to store and remember gifts given to them by loved ones.  </p>

		<p id="indent">FROM is the only app designed to help people organize and catalog their gifts and cards all in one place. After receiving a present, you can use FROM to virtually store your special item, documenting it with pictures and details—who, what, when, where, why, and even how you felt when you received the gift! Using FROM, you can then share your gift with friends via social media and send a beautiful thank-you card to the giver. Later, you can access all of the details about your gift using a variety of search features.</p>

		<p>We hope that FROM will assist you not only in collecting and remembering the gifts you've been given, but also in savoring the experience you had upon receiving and unwrapping them—your excitement, gratitude, curiosity, and joy. Whether you celebrated an anniversary, birthday, holiday, or received a "just because" gift, FROM allows you to hold onto your memories forever.</p>

		<p style="font-style:italic;" >Let the gifting begin!</p>
